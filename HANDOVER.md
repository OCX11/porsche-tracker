# PTOX11 — Porsche Market Intelligence Platform
*Last updated: April 19, 2026*

---

## 1. Project Overview

Autonomous Porsche market intelligence platform on a Mac Mini M4. Scrapes 10 sources every 12 minutes, scores every listing against FMV using 6,024 BaT sold comps, and fires iOS push notifications the moment a new listing enters the DB.

**Repo:** https://github.com/OCX11/PTOX11  
**Dashboard:** https://ocx11.github.io/PTOX11/  
**Auctions:** https://ocx11.github.io/PTOX11/auctions.html  
**Machine:** Mac Mini M4, user: claw, 24/7

### Business Context
Small performance car dealership. All purchases are investments. Core range $70K–$150K, GT/collector no ceiling.

## 5. Database

### Tables
- **listings** — active + sold. Key columns: `dealer`, `year`, `make`, `model`, `trim`, `mileage`, `price`, `vin`, `listing_url`, `image_url`, `image_url_cdn`, `source_category`, `tier`, `created_at`, `date_first_seen`, `date_last_seen`, `auction_ends_at`, `status`, `feed_type`
- **price_history** — every price change per listing (silent tracking, no alerts)
- **sold_comps** — 6,024 records, 84% with generation filled. Auto-expires >24mo on each comp scrape run.
- **bat_reserve_not_met** — BaT auctions that didn't meet reserve (price floor signal)
- **snapshots** — daily raw snapshots per dealer

### upsert_listing dedup priority
1. VIN match (most reliable)
2. listing_url match (catches eBay/DuPont correctly)
3. DuPont fallback: car ID tail match (survives URL format changes)
4. year/make/model fallback (non-eBay, non-DuPont only)

### FMV Engine
- Source: BaT sold comps (weight 1.0), recency decay ≤6 months full → 0.3 at 24 months
- Groups by: generation + trim family
- Confidence: HIGH (10+ comps) / MEDIUM (4-9) / LOW (1-3) / NONE (0)
- Current: 78% HIGH, 22% MEDIUM, <1% LOW
- **⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE:** Some estimates are significantly off. Full audit + rebuild is 🔴 High Priority next task. Approach: owner walks through known-bad examples → trace comps → fix logic in fmv.py.

| Scraper health push | ✅ ACTIVE | 3 consecutive zero-run cycles → push alert |
| Scheduler stuck push | ✅ ACTIVE | Log not updated in 30min → push alert |

## 9. Open Items / Roadmap

### High Priority
1. **FMV engine audit + rebuild** — owner to walk through known-bad examples, trace comps, fix logic

### Queue (ready to build)
2. Days-on-market chip ✅ DONE — commit 789a7dd00
3. Auction result auto-capture ✅ DONE — commit f5145ec09
4. AutoTrader image coverage — medium priority, monitor

### Needs Owner Input
5. Auto-fix health monitor — scope safe-fix scenarios
6. Interactive pricing graph — active + sold comps, hoverable
7. Manual FMV calculator — off-market car valuation tool
8. Watchlist alerts by spec — e.g. "991.2 GT3 Touring manual only"
9. Seller intelligence — flag repeat/disguised dealers
10. New scrapers — Hagerty, Porsche NA CPO, CarGurus, Hemmings
11. Manheim API — low priority, wholesale data
